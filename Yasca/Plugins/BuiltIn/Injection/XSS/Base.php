Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to
impersonate or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.

This particular issue is caused by writing user-controlled data directly to the page.
For instance, consider the following snippet:
	<%=request.getParameter("q")%>.

The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a victim to visit a URL
with specially crafted JavaScript to perform actions on the site on behalf of the
attacker, or to simply steal the session cookie.

A solution to this problem would be HtmlEncoding at the sink.
