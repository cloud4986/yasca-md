It is important to use strong passwords that are difficult to guess.
This finding indicates that a password was chosen that falls into
one of the following categories:

* Repeated String (i.e. foo2foo)
* Password Matching UserID
* Blank UserID/Password
* Password Ending in "4ever"
* Seasonal Password (i.e. summer12)
* Common Password (based on reported "most common" passwords)

If these passwords are required to remain hard-coded, they should be changed to something
stronger (at least 128-bits of entropy).
